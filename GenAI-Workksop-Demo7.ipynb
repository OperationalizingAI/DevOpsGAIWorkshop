However, it can be challenging to understand what is going on under the hood and to pinpoint the cause of issues. Phoenix makes your LLM applications *observable* by visualizing the underlying structure of each call to your query engine and surfacing problematic `spans`` of execution based on latency, token count, or other evaluation metrics.\n","\n","In this tutorial, you will:\n","- Generate data into a MongoDB Collection to be later used as a Vector Store.\n","- Build a simple query engine using LlamaIndex that uses retrieval-augmented generation to answer questions over the Arize documentation,\n","- Record trace data in [OpenInference tracing](https://github.com/Arize-ai/open-inference-spec/blob/main/trace/spec/traces.md) format using the global `arize_phoenix` handler\n","- Inspect the traces and spans of your application to identify sources of latency and cost,\n","- Export your trace data as a pandas dataframe and run an [LLM Evals](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/concepts/llm-evals) to measure the precision@k of the query engine's retrieval step.\n","\n","ℹ️ This notebook requires an OpenAI API key."],"metadata":{"id":"NqjcGG9QJhUJ"},"id":"NqjcGG9QJhUJ"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.
