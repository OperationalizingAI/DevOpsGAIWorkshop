For example, a\\xa0CodeComponent\\xa0entity may want to declare who its owner is by mentioning a Team or Person entity, and a Person entity may want to declare what Team entities it is a member of. This describes how to write those references in your yaml entity declaration files.  \\nEach entity in OpenContext is uniquely identified by the triplet of its\\xa0[kind,\\xa0namespace, and\\xa0name](common). But that's a lot to type out manually, and in a lot of circumstances, both the kind and the namespace are fixed, or possible to deduce, or could have sane default values.  \\nEach reference can be expressed in one of two ways: as a compact string, or as a compound reference structure.\", metadata={'Header 1': 'Entity Reference'}), Document(page_content=\"## **String References**  \\nThis is the most common alternative, that should be used in almost all circumstances.  \\nThe string is on the form\\xa0`[<kind>:][<namespace>/]<name>`, that is, it is composed of between one and three parts in this specific order, without any additional encoding:  \\n- Optionally, the kind, followed by a colon\\n- Optionally, the namespace, followed by a forward slash. This is only required when the namespace is not `default`\\n- The name  \\nThe name is always required. Depending on the context, you may be able to leave out the kind and/or namespace. If you do, it is contextual what values will be used, and the relevant documentation should specify which rule applies where. All strings are case insensitive.  \\n```yaml\\napiVersion: opencontext.com/v1alpha1\\nkind: AuxComponent\\nmetadata:\\nname: crates-docs\\ntitle: Crates docs\\ndescription: Crates documentation\\ntags:\\n- java\\nspec:\\ntype: document\\nlifecycle: production\\nowner: [person:sean]\\nservice: crates\\nuri: https://example.com/docs\\n```  \\nThe field\\xa0`spec.owner`\\xa0is a reference. In this case, the string\\xa0`person:sean`\\xa0was given by the user. That means that the kind is\\xa0`Person`, the namespace is left out, and the name is\\xa0`sean`. In this context, the namespace was chosen to fall back to the value\\xa0`default`\\xa0by the code that parsed the reference, so the end result is that we expect to find another entity in the catalog that is of kind\\xa0`Person`, namespace\\xa0`default`\\xa0(which, actually, also can be left out in its own yaml file because that's the default value there too), and name\\xa0`sean`.  \\nThe entry in\\xa0`spec.service` is also a reference. In this case, it doesn’t need to specify a kind since we know from the context that that's the only kind that's supported here.

All fields of this structure are also optional.\\n- **displayEmail** would be a team email of some form, that the team may wish to be used for contacting them.\\n- **picture** is expected to be a URL pointing to an image that's representative of the team, and that a browser could fetch and render on a team page or similar.\\n- **timezone** should be in the form of [TZ database name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).\\n- **slackHandle** is the team’s handle name in Slack.\\n- **pagerHandle** is the team’s handle name in the paging service of choice.\\n- **parent** (string) [optional]\\nThe immediate parent team in the hierarchy, if any. Not all teams must have a parent. OpenContext supports multi-root hierarchies. Teams may however not have more than one parent. This field is an [entity reference](entity-reference).\\nFor example: ops, cloud-security\\n- **children** (string array) [required]\\nThe immediate child teams of this team in the hierarchy (whose parent field points to this team). The list must be present, but may be empty if there are no child teams. The items are not guaranteed to be ordered in any particular way. The entries of this array are [entity references](entity-reference).\\nFor example: engineering, product\\n- **members** (string array) [optional]\\nThe people that are members of this team. The entries of this array are [entity references](entity-reference).\\nFor example: jdoe\", metadata={'Header 1': 'Kind: Team', 'Header 2': 'Spec'}), Document(page_content='## Examples  \\nThese example YAML configurations are all shown as if they were in their own file.
